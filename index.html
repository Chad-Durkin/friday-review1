      <div class="the-about-me">
        <p class="about-me">So heres a little bit about me, my name is Chad Durkin, I'm 23 years old, and I was born in Chester, California. I grew up in a small town of maybe 2000 people, I went to <span class="csu-color"><strong>Chico State University</strong></span> for a few years pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics.</p>
        <p class="about-me">I have taken a few Math classes that are Computer Science, and I've also taken a few high level programming classes primarilary focused on object oriented programming using C++. I've played around with HTML and CSS on my own time, creating quite a few mock websites to see what I could do, and I ended up really enjoying it. I needed a break from college, so I started looking into ways that I could gain some job experience with programming before I went back and finished my degree, which is when I came accross Epicodus.
        <p class="about-me">I am now pursuing a Web Development career, going through Epicodus primarily to get rigurous training in Web Development to be able to have the skills I need to get a job on the other end.
        <p class="about-me">I plan on going back and finishing my degree hopefully in 2 years, after I have found a job that I love in Web Development, to be able to add ontop of my skillset and open up doors to advancements in my career.</p>
